# GHauth-Discord-Code-Forwarder

### TODO: change this readme. its mid right now....

The purpose of this project is to create a discord bot that will forward GitHub auth codes (from gmail) for logging in to a Discord server. This is mainly to streamline the process of getting people to migrate from ZeroTier/Hamachi to a Tailscale net.

This project aims to be a bare-bones discord bot that can be deployed easily, and with low maintenance.

I haven't used the discordpy library in a while, and I've never used a Gmail API call, so this should be a first. I'm also considering making a Docker container because I've never messed with Docker before.

I might also come back to this idea with a later bot to merge its functionality with another bot I have planned.
